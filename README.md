4. CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise) 
5. NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million) 
6. RM: average number of rooms per dwelling 
7. AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 
8. DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres 
9. RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways 
10. TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000 
11. PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town 
12. B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town 
13. LSTAT: % lower status of the population 
14. MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's 
15. Optimum is achieved at the branch size of 8 as seen in the image below.
